# Adaptive Routing with Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning on Dragonfly Networks

hierarchical.ipynb is for Q-hierarchical routing test

shortest.ipynb is for Minimal and Global routing test

VAL.ipynb is for VAL routing test

qroute.ipynb is for Q-routing test

qadapt.ipynb is for Q-adaptive routing test



The routing algorithms is stored in the models folder

dragonfly_generator.py provides useful functions for generating and reading different dragonfly topologies
